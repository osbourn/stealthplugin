# Scripts

These are highly-personalized scripts to automate the setup of this plugin on
servers. It is probably better to modify these scripts for your own need or
use them as reference than use them as-is.

Currently, the only script available is `setup-linux.sh`, which sets up a new
Minecraft server on a linux computer. Run it with
```bash
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osbourn/stealthplugin/master/scripts/setup-linux.sh' | bash
```
